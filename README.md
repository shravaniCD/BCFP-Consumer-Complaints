# BCFP-Consumer-Complaints

The dataset is a collection of consumer complaints in the financial sector across all the states of USA containing features like name of the company, product, issue etc. This dataset is updated every 15 days and in this project I use data taken until 15/12/2019. Some of the questions that can be addressed from this data are:

--> Given the complaint, predict a timely response.
--> Given the complaint, classify the type of company response.
--> Given the complaint, predict the probability of dispute.

The above three objectives can be dealt with supervised-learning algorithms.

As an additional outcome, the consumer sentiment on the complaint can also be predicted by making use of the NLP.
