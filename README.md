# BCFP-Consumer-Complaints

The dataset is a collection of consumer complaints in the financial sector across all the states of USA. This dataset is updated every 15 days and in this project I use data taken until 15/12/2019 (which amounts to approximately 1.5 million complaints) for training/testing machine learning algorithms. The data after this date can be used for validation purpose.

The dataset contains information on date, product, type of issue of a complaint along with the company and the geographical location (state of the USA). Additional features include response of the company to consumer, to public and the complainant narrative of the issue. 

Some of the questions that can be addressed from this data are:

--> Given the complaint, predict a Untimely response.

--> Given the complaint, classify the type of company response.

--> Given the complaint, predict the probability of dispute.

The above three objectives can be dealt with supervised-learning algorithms.

As an additional outcome, the consumer sentiment on the complaint can also be predicted by making use of the NLP.
